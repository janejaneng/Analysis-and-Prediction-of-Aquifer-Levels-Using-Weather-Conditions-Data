<h2>Introduction</h2>
PNJB is honored to participate in the 2023 Data Science Competition organized by the Analytics and Information Systems Club and the Kansas Data Science Consortium at the University of Kansas.
This analysis is the teamâ€™s attempt to predict aquifer level recorded by Viaanix at the Ryan and Eugene Goering Water Technology Farm mainly in R. A general method involves fitting different simple models before comparing them on a variety of criteria. There exist one limitations in data source although they do not deviate the suggest results from being optimal in this contex
