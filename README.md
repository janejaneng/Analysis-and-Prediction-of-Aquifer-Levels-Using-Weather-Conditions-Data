<h2>Introduction</h2>
PNJB is honored to participate in the 2023 Data Science Competition organized by the Analytics and Information Systems Club and the Kansas Data Science Consortium at the University of Kansas.
This analysis is the team’s attempt to predict aquifer level recorded by Viaanix at the Ryan and Eugene Goering Water Technology Farm mainly in R. A general method involves fitting different simple models before comparing them on a variety of criteria. There exist one limitations in data source although they do not deviate the suggest results from being optimal in this contex

<h2>Methods</h2>
The readers can expect a thorough process from deciding which data to collect, preparing and cleaning the data, performing exploratory data analysis, examining the data’s time series characteristics, and conducting a variety of model fittings to find the optimal solutions.
We carefully studied the data with graphical and technical examinations of the variables. Certain cleaning steps were applied to issues that were detected to improve data quality.
The analysis explores the possibility for linear regression and time series regression as the potential solutions. It also combines three other model engines to conduct a thorough comparison and error test.
